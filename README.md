Hi, this is my little collection of relatively simple demos I made for the purposes of learning
raylib properly.

## List of programs included

1. [nbody](src/nbody/README.md)
  ![Nbody simulation](images/nbody.gif?raw=true "An nbody simulator")
2. [rain](src/rain/README.md)
  ![Rain animation](images/rain.gif?raw=true "Basic rain falling")
3. flame
  (There would be an animation here, but it's a bit spastic to really demonstrate at the moment)
4. flame2
  ![Flame particles](images/flame2.gif "A bunch of particles that roughly resemble a fire")
5. [Crystal](src/crystal/README.md)
  A brownian crystal generator.
