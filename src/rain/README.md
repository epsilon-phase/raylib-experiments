Rain. It's a very simple rain animation.

With apologies to Packbats, her far finer program may be found here:

Which in turn was inspired by this: https://botwiki.org/bot/rain-gif/

Key controls:

* R - Reset the rain, reinitialize it so that a different loop results
* B - Cycle through background colors
* Left/Right Cycle through raindrop colors
