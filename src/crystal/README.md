This program produces what are called Brownian Crystals, wherein particles
move around randomly until they touch a seed particle and adhere to it.

As of now there are not many shortcuts that are relevant for this program,
it mostly runs itself.

Once it runs out of moving particles it takes a screenshot and saves it as
`Crystal-NNN.png` and reset. This behavior should be controllable in future
versions.

Here's what exists so far:

* R -- Reset the crystal
* T - Toggle drawing the text over the crystal
* S - Suspend drawing of the particles and crystals.
